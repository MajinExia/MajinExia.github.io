                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>The Globe Pulsed Field System, developped by Kardium, is a new tool that assist the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AFib), aiming to help more than 50 million people worldwide through making procedures more accurate and efficient.</p>
                    
                    <p>My experience working at Kardium greatly expanded my capabilities as a designer. I was provided with the opportunity to learn, collaborate with various teams, and present to stakeholders and real world users weekly, elevating their visions into insights-driven features and product improvements.</p>

                    <p>My primary role in this project involved conducting <span>design audits, ensuring accessibility compliance</span> with WCAG standards, managing the <span>design library</span>, and creating <span>guidelines for future development.</span></p>

                    <p><span> NOTE: Due to NDA restrictions, this case study will only highlights the key tasks I contributed to creating standard guidelines for Kardium's design system at a high-level with contents replaced or left out.</span> If you'd like more details about my work, please feel free to <a href="mailto:lukedo2111@gmail.com" class="footer-link">contact me via my email!</a></p>

                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>With the Kardium’s first commercial cases happening in 2025, it was clear that Kardium's Globe Software will need to be as feature-packed as possible to compete with existing competitors in the market. To meet this growing scope, Kardium's product UX and development team had to focus on addressing various usuability issues and developping new market defining features.</p>
                    <p>However, this rapid cycle of implementation meant inevitably creating an increasing divergence between the UX and development design libraries. Each team would rely on its own tools and naming conventions for different workflows, resulting in <span>inconsistencies, friction, and a design system that made collaboration difficult.</span> Even minor changes could take days to implement, <span>slowing both teams down and making iteration frustrating </span>given the nature of back and forth conversations.</p>

                    <h3>Conducting Design Audits</h3>
                    <p>Starting in June, I took on the responsibility of managing our design library, with the first step  being to conduct design audits of Kardium’s current Figma asset library and software implementations of different dialog boxes and other design elements. From this I synthesized the common design patterns, what was working well and areas that needed improvement, as well as <span>discovering the differences between the design mock up specs that the UX team were creating versus the software implementation</span> by the UI developers.</p>
                    <p>The audit process also involved 1:1 meetings with UX Designers, as well as meeting with UI developers from the development team to understand the process and workflow in implementing a feature after receiving the mockup specs from the UX Design team.</p>

                        <p>To unify the design system across both Product UX and the development team, <span>I collaborated with our Senior UX Manager and a Staff Software Engineer to start refactoring our UX design library from the atom level</span> in form of fonts, matching the UX’s library to the list of different font sizes and naming scheme in the software provided by developers’ team and from there, working my way up, updating the buttons (molecule), dialog sections (organism) and ending with template/page in the form of a sample UI frame with all the elements from the design system.</p>

                        <p>In this process, I also ensure a transparent and clear communication channel between UX and development through having weekly meetings as well as updating them on the different changes in the new design standards</p>

                    <p>The experience I gained at Kardium was invaluable in my journey as a designer as I was able to see various projects from start to finish in a real world setting.
