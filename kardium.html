                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Kardium is a rapidly growing medical solutions company that has developed the Globe Pulsed Field System, an advanced system for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AFib), aiming to assist more than 50 million people worldwide through making procedures more accurate and efficient.</p>
                
                <p>My experience working at Kardium greatly expanded my capabilities as a designer. I was provided with the opportunity to learn, collaborate with various teams, and present to stakeholders and real world users weekly, elevating their visions into insights driven features and product improvements.</p>

                <!-- <p>My primary role in this project involved conducting design audits, updating Kardium’s design asset library on Figma, ensuring accessibility compliance with WCAG standards, documenting new design patterns and creating guidelines for current design components (such as dialog boxes, icons, tool palette, etc.) for future features and improvements.</p> -->

                <p><span> Due to NDA restrictions, this case study will only highlights the key tasks I contributed to Kardium's design system a high-level with contents blurred/replaced or left out. If you'd like more details about my work, please feel free to contact me via my email!</span></p>

                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>With the Kardium’s first commercial cases happening in 2025, it was clear that Kardium's Globe Software will need to be as feature-packed as possible to compete with existing competitors in the market. To meet this growing scope, Kardium's product UX and development team had to focus on addressing various usuability issues and developping new market defining features.</p>
                    <p>However, this rapid cycle of implementation meant inevitably creating an increasing divergence between the UX and development design libraries. Each team would rely on its own tools and naming conventions for different workflows, resulting in inconsistencies, friction, and a design system that made collaboration difficult. Even minor changes could take days to implement, slowing both teams down and making iteration frustrating given the number of back and forth conversation between them.</p>

                    <h3>Conducting Design Audits</h3>
                    <p>Starting in June, I took on the responsibility of managing our design library, started conducting design audits of Kardium’s current Figma asset library and software implementations of different dialog boxes and other design elements. From this I synthesized the common design patterns, what was working well and areas that needed improvement, as well as discovering the differences between the design mock up specs that the UX team were creating versus the software implementation by the UI developers afterwards.</p>
                    <p>The audit process also involved 1:1 meetings with UX Designers, as well as meeting with UI developers from the development team to understand the process and workflow in implementing a feature after receiving the mockup specs from the UX Design team.</p>

                        <p>To unify the design system across both Product UX and the development team, I collaborated with a Senior UX Designer and a Staff Software Engineer to start refactoring our UX design library from the atom level in form of fonts, matching the UX’s library to the list of different font sizes and naming scheme in the software provided by developers’ team and from there, working my way up the design system, updating the buttons (molecule), dialog sections (organism) and ending with template/page in the form of a sample UI frame with all the elements from the design system.</p>

                    <p>Before, handing off work would always meant some level of manual interpretation between designers and developers. That left room for small discrepancies and slowed down implementation.</p>
                    <p>Now with the newly unified set of design standards, the handoff process became radically simpler. Every component, in this case dialog box, comes with an annotated sheet with examples, general specs, documenting supported states, and accessibility guidance. UI Developers and Product UX Designers now work from a single source of truth—reducing ambiguity, eliminating redundant documentation, and accelerating time to implement features.</p>

                    <p>When iterating on what how FurEverHome could differentiate itself, the team conducted a competitive analysis with each of us downloading a different dog app, using them for a week and then coming back as a team to discuss what they did well and what they are missing. One thing that we noticed while researching was that apart from encompassing a wider selection of features than other pet dog apps, FurEverHome truly stands out as the only application on the market (from our research) that focuses solely on rescue dogs.</p>

                        <p>To gain a better understanding of how users would approach FurEverHome, the team conducted in-person user testing with 8 people consisting of 2 primary users, 4 secondary users and 2 volunteers, asking them to perform a setlist of different tasks utilising observation and the think-aloud method in combination with questionnaires.</p>
                        <p>However, after conducting these interviews, it was pointed out that while the features were well throught out, the prototype at that time still had issues with usability in parts of the UI and copywriting in the volunteer flow. After considering the user’s feedback, as a team, we made adjustments and fleshing out the UI even more with usability being our top priority and improving on the copywriting to better communicate to users better. These changes led us to create our fully interactive prototype with 3 distinct user flows. <span> Here I was in charge of primarily in charge of prototyping the prospective user flow as well as helping my teammates prototype the primary and volunteer user flow </span></p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>As my first real UI/UX project that I have done in my academic career, I’m really proud of what my teammates and I were able to achieve, gaining both praise from fellow classmates and the teaching team during our final showcase. I was able to <span>learn how to efficiently prototype a fully functional prototype application using Figma's components</span>.</p>
                <p>I've also gained a better understanding of the importance of qualitative research and its differences from quantitative and secondary research. I also learned how to create interview questions that <span>don't lead the interviewee and encourage them to provide detailed and natural responses</span>. Furthermore, I gotten more experience of collaborating within a team when developing a mobile application, especially keeping each other informed, and most importantly working together to overcome challenges we encountered <span>basing our decisions on our research and user’s insights.</span></p>
