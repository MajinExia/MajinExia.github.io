                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>After studying the principles, and heuristics of Interface Design, FurEverHome was created in a group of four as a platform to support new and prospective rescued dog owners in their journey with their beloved furry friends. Utilizing Figma over 6 weeks, I was primarily responsible for user research and testing, creating different iterations and features of the UI as well as prototyping a fully working prototype of one of our experience flows in the application. </p>

                    <h3>The issue at hand</h3>
                    <p>Approaching this project, my teammates and I first sought out research and journal articles, focusing on secondary research to familiarise ourselves with this domain and figure out if this is a domain we could potentially intervene and address with design. These articles pointed to resistance among potential and newly rescued dog owners with The Zebra’s survey noting <span>60% of adopted pets are returned or given away after 6 months, citing concerns about potential health risks and a lack of knowledge on how to effectively care for rescued pets.</span></p>

                    <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                    <p>To gain a better understanding of how pet owners and pet shelters view their experience with rescued dogs and the difference between them and buying from breeders, we <span>conducted user interviews with 7 participants, each being 30 minutes long on both Zoom and in person</span>, with 4 people who adopted from breeders, 2 who adopted rescues and a volunteer from the SPCA, a local animal shelters.</p>
                    <p>These interviews pointed to the general mindset of online information being sufficient but preferred hearing stories from experienced pet owners for specific insights. Common issues faced by pet owners include health, hygiene, and behavioral concerns with their pets, while common reasons for adopting pets include companionship, a love for animals, and a desire to practice caregiving.</p>

From that we also created a user journey map to help the team further understand the different touchpoints and emotions a newly rescued pet owner, who we identified as our primary user, might have to guide our design decisions in developing the application.</p>

                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                    <p>When iterating on what how FurEverHome could differentiate itself, the team conducted a competitive analysis with each of us downloading a different dog app, using them for a week and then coming back as a team to discuss what they did well and what they are missing. One thing that we noticed while researching was that apart from encompassing a wider selection of features than other pet dog apps, FurEverHome truly stands out as the only application on the market (from our research) that focuses solely on rescue dogs.</p>

                        <p>To gain a better understanding of how users would approach FurEverHome, the team conducted in-person user testing with 8 people consisting of 2 primary users, 4 secondary users and 2 volunteers, asking them to perform a setlist of different tasks utilising observation and the think-aloud method in combination with questionnaires.</p>
                        <p>However, after conducting these interviews, it was pointed out that while the features were well throught out, the prototype at that time still had issues with usability in parts of the UI and copywriting in the volunteer flow. After considering the user’s feedback, as a team, we made adjustments and fleshing out the UI even more with usability being our top priority and improving on the copywriting to better communicate to users better. These changes led us to create our fully interactive prototype with 3 distinct user flows. Here I was in charge of primarily in charge of prototyping the secondary user flow as well as helping my teammates prototype the primary and volunteer user flow</p>

                <p>As my first real UI/UX project that I have done in my academic career, I’m really proud of what my teammates and I were able to achieve, gaining both praise from fellow classmates and the teaching team during our final showcase. I was able to <span>learn how to efficiently prototype a fully functional prototype application using Figma's components</span>.</p>
                <p>I've also gained a better understanding of the importance of qualitative research and its differences from quantitative and secondary research. I also learned how to create interview questions that <span>don't lead the interviewee and encourage them to provide detailed and natural responses</span>. Furthermore, I gotten more experience of collaborating within a team when developing a mobile application, especially keeping each other informed, and most importantly working together to overcome challenges we encountered <span>basing our decisions on our research and user’s insights.</span></p>
