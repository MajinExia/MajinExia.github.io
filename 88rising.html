                    <h2>Setting The Stage</h2>
                    <p>88rising is a multi-media record label that aims to create a platform for Asian and Asian-American talents, bridging the gap between the East and the West. They have quickly became a cultural phenomenon, gaining over 3 billion views within 3 years on YouTube.</p>

                    <p>However, 88rising has since <span>faced issues with discoverability. Within the past 4 years, they’ve only accumulated 0.43 billion views</span> on YouTube and have struggled with providing their new artists with the same reach that they formerly had.</p>
                    
                    <p>During this 6 weeks long project, I <span>led the user research</span>, as well as contributed as a <span>interaction designer</span> while also being the <span>decision maker</span> during our design sprints.</p>

                <h3>Framing the issue</h3>
                <p>After considering both the business and consumers’ perspectives, my teammates and I saw a missed opportunity for 88rising as many fans weren’t engaging and discovering more of 88rising’s roster due to many of their artists and collaborative content being scattered across different platforms. <span>As the decision maker for the team, I believed that by leveraging 88rising’s unique Asian American identity and collaborative works from diverse artists across different cultural backgrounds, we could help fans discover and connect more with artists and provide artists with a piece of the spotlight they have lacked until now.</span></p>

                <h2>Inital Ideations</h2>
                <p> While these first few iterations had potential, the execution wasn't there just yet in terms of interaction and visual design. As such, we refined our approach to better balance 88rising's goals with our content strategy. <span>In this stage, I led the design of the layout, interactions as well as content organization of the landing page and the artist page</span>. While this improved the overall concept, the artists' page was noted for lacking cohesion and needing stronger integration with the site's design.</p>

                    <p>Looking back, this was definitely the most challenging project I’ve been a part of and it was really an eye-opening experience, especially during my first-ever design sprint where I got the chance to be the team’s decision maker. I <span>learned how to frame problems properly, make design decisions, and quickly generate and test those ideas.</span> This rapid and hyper-focused process of iterating and feedback between user interviews and the teaching staff taught me to <span>challenge every assumption I might have  through research data.</span></p>

                    <p>Another crucial lesson that I learned the hard way is to truly <span>trust the design process.</span> In the beginning, the team spent 3-4 weeks constantly doubting ourselves as we weren't able to lock in the "perfect" problem space rather than letting the framing develop as we research and gather more insights. This constant back and forth delayed the project until the final weeks of the project timeline.</p>
