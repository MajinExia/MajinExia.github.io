                    <h2>Project Description</h2>
                    <p>88rising is a renowned record label and entertainment company to represents Asian culture in the West. What truly sets them apart from other record labels is their ethos of challenging existing stereotypes through showcasing how Asians can equally have a voice in the music industry, providing these seemingly “unheard” voices a platform to flourish. This redesigned 88rising experience serves as a touchpoint for fans, offering a unique journey to explore details about their favourite artists, while also supporting lesser-known talents, thereby expanding their influence.</p>
                    <p>I was responsible for conducting user research, content strategy, interactions design, copywriting while also being the decision maker during our design sprints.</p>

                    <h3>The root of the issue</h3>
                    <p>The team researched online for secondary data in combination with user interviews and surveys with <span>89 respondents</span> (1 over 88!!), ranging from casual to die-hard fans regarding their music-sharing habits, and their perception of 88rising and its artist roster.</p>
                    <p>These interviews pointed to a lack of awareness within the fanbase of 88rising’s frequent releases with <span>62% of respondents not aware of their monthly releases.</span> Another question that was brought up during the survey was if they agree that 88rising is declining in popularity, to which the majority of the survey respondents agreed. However, when asked the reason why, <span>41% of our casual fans respondents attributed it to the lack of engagement</span> from the brand themselves, despite having an interest in 88rising’s new talents and their signature sounds.</p>

                <h3>Why redesign the 88rising website?</h3>
                <p><span>88rising's current website primarily focuses on merchandise</span>, lacking clarity on its current roster of artists and background information. Although YouTube serves as a significant touchpoint for their original content, it is scattered across various channels, <span>making it challenging for fans to discover and learn more</span> about their favourite artists.</p>

                <p>After considering both the business and consumers’ perspectives, my teammates and I saw a missed opportunity for 88rising as many fans weren’t engaging and discovering more of 88rising’s roster due to many of their artists and collaborative content being scattered across different platforms. We believed that by <span>leveraging 88rising’s unique Asian American identity and collaborative works from diverse artists across different cultural backgrounds, we could help fans discover and connect more with artists and provide artists with a piece of the spotlight they have lacked until now.</span></p>

                    <p><span>This intervention invites both fans and visitors to explore 88rising as a whole and delve deeper into artists they may not have heard of previously.</span> Throughout the site, fans can watch and listen to different collaborations and stories from artists, revealing the inspirations, cultural context, and symbolism of their songs while also giving fans a preview of who they are behind the screen. With user sharability and discoverbility in mind, our proposal aims to simplify discovery and support lesser-known artists from 88rising through establishing connections with the audience.

                    <p>Each of 88rising’s artists pairs unheard voices with a distinctive style that sets them apart from conventional artists and each other. To express this, the artist collaboration page strayed away from traditional grids as <span>a way to provide a more vibrant and energetic experience, with the use of opposing motions representing a new wave of clashing cultures.</span></p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>Looking back, this was definitely the most challenging project I’ve been a part of and it was really an eye-opening experience, especially during my first-ever design sprint where I got the chance to be the team’s decision maker. I learned how to frame problems properly, make design decisions, and quickly generate and test those ideas. This rapid and hyper-focused process of iterating and feedback between user interviews and the teaching staff taught me to <span>truly not design in my head and to challenge every assumption I might have beforehand through research data.</span></p>

                    <p>Another crucial lesson that I learned the hard way is to truly <span>trust the process and let the problem space take shape as time goes on.</span> In the beginning, the team spent 3-4 weeks constantly doubting ourselves as we weren't able to lock in the "perfect" problem space rather than letting the framing develop as we research and gather more insights. This constant back and forth delayed the project until the final weeks of the project timeline.</p>
